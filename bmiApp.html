          <!-- Project 1 -->

            <h3>Input</h3>
            <p>The user is first presented with this view. Depending on which country the user is in the may want to use the imperial system instead of the metric one, so I've made it easy for them by alowing the user to change back and forth at the press of a button (technically they have to tap on the "Imperial" segment since its actually a Segmented Control). The labels and UISliders are linked to this switch/button and will adjust accordingly when it is toggled. The labels are of course linked to the sliders so that they change when the sliders are adjusted. Once the user has put in their height and weight, the calculate button is pressed and their BMI slides up on a new view.</p>

            <h3>Output</h3>
            <p>Once the user has pressed the calculate button, if the imperial system was used the values are imediatly converted into metric values, and only then is the BMI is calculated. The second view is the prepared before a seway takes place. On the second view there are only two things displayed, the users calculated BMI and recalculate button so that the user can go back and perform another calculation.</p>

          <h2>Auto Layout</h2>
          <p>I used the main storyboard to create the auto layout constraints. The current iteration of the app is unable to run on anyting smaller than an iPhone SE (2nd generation), anything else is fine.</p>
