            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>
              The game starts as soon as the user opens the app. The goal of the
               game is to keep chopping penguins without chopping any bombs. If a
               bomb is chopped, the game stops and the user looses immediatly, 
               similarly if three penguins go unchopped the game will end. The 
               X's in the top right hand corner indicate to the player how many 
               chances they have left.
            </p>
            <h3>What happening behind the scenes</h3>
              <p>
                In the GameViewController start by loading the SKscene from 'GameScene.sks', setting the
                 scale mode to scale to fit the window and then presenting the scene
                 itself.
                 <p>
                  In the GameScene we start by setting up the background and then giving
                   the items in our world physics. We then declare the sequence in which the items will be
                   thrown up the first time around after which we take that sequence and randomise it until 
                  the user runs out of lives. I've created functions for creating the score label, creating
                   the users lives/hearts, generating slices, creating enemies, subtracting lives, ending the game, etc.
                   All working working in tadem to bring the experience you see on screen.

          <h2>Auto Layout</h2>
          <p>I used the main storyboard to create the auto layout constraints. The current iteration of the app only runs on iPads.</p>
